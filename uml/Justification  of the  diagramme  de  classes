1. Role of Each Class

Book
The Book class represents the resources available in the digital library.
It contains the main characteristics of a book (title, author, availability) and allows the system to track which books can be borrowed.

User
The User class models the members of the library.
It manages user registration and their interactions with the system, particularly borrowing and returning books.

Loan
The Loan class represents the business relationship between a user and a book.
It stores information about a borrowing operation, such as the date of the loan and its status (active or closed).
This separation ensures that borrowing logic is not mixed with the Book or User classes, following the Single Responsibility Principle.

Library
The Library class is the central class of the system.
It orchestrates all business rules, including book management, user registration, loan tracking, book returns, and displaying the overall state of the library.

2. Justification of the Relationships Between Classes

The relationship between Loan and Book is 1-to-1, because each loan corresponds to a single book.

The relationship between Loan and User is also 1-to-1, as each loan is made by a single user.

The relationship between Library and the classes Book, User, and Loan is an aggregation, because the library contains multiple books, users, and loans while maintaining the independence of these entities.

The optional relationship between User and Book indicates that a user may borrow multiple books over time; this is effectively managed through the Loan class.

3. Coherence Between UML Design and Implementation

The class diagram is fully consistent with the Python implementation.
Each UML class corresponds directly to a Python class, and all relationships are represented in the code through attributes and object references.
This alignment ensures the system is clear, maintainable, and extensible, while respecting object-oriented principles and proper separation of responsibilities.
