Library Management in Python
Description

This project is a library management system developed in Python.
It allows managing books, users (members), and loans, following a clear and professional object-oriented architecture.
I used the following names: Book (class Book), User (class User), Loan (class Loan), Library (class Library).

The project relies on separate classes to represent the main entities and includes a UML diagram to illustrate their relationships.
